              Situated in the rugged up market leafy suburb of Plumstead (next to an accredited medical practitioner for “sick notes”), surrounded by upscale pubs and restaurants (which is a definite
              leading cause to high blood / low blood pressure, diabetes, gout, sleepiness, insomnia etc., according to any spouse).

              The atmosphere in the studio is what we want with an eclectic range of treffers, known as the “HOME OF YAADT” (with copies from an array of dee-jays and wanna be dee-jays), often wishing
              to be "two places at the same time", as one of our staff was the original guy to take the broom and sweep the yard. From the soft soothing “binne boud” jams to the hard biting the head
              off an innocent locust tunes with the occasional seasonal dependent jams from Boney M during Christmas, Jaloos Bokkie on National Braai Day to even that elusive Kat Stevens jams on those
              two special days in the year ;), to also catering to our own local African treffers. In the evening there is a soothing atmospheric neon illumination which gives the studio an Amsterdam
              like nostalgia bringing a “fuzzy” feeling to oneself.

            <h1>Q: WHY DOES MY TATTOO BLEED?</h1>
            <p>
              A:That's what happens when a needle goes into your skin. Our Staff are locally bred with imported seed, native to the indigenous Khoisan soil blown from the winds of the Cape of Storms,
              once voted the no.1 most popular place to visit in 1652 by Jan van Riebeek (V.O.C) , and they are well-travelled individuals (Home to work and back again mostly). We once formed a
              vigilante superhero group called ‘The Pretenders’ but disbanded at the end of the game. None of ‘The Pretenders’ were billionaires (who could afford fancy gadgets) or orphans or had any
              sort of super power but was rumoured to be able to stop a bullet at least once. Medication dependent, at the right dose, between naps, we will give you service of value. We once rated
              ourselves 4.8 stars (we think we overrated! ). Armed with a highly equipped standard occasionally fully functional upgraded Windows 8 software programmed computer system with a very low
              speeded internet connection and refurbished dot matrix printer we can almost find any picture you found. With customer satisfaction is occasionally guaranteed: So if beards offend you,
              we’ll make the bastard (Artist) shave :D (Labour laws pending) If the artist likes you he/she will answer all questions in interpretive dance. We also always almost have a lifeguard on
              duty so the chances of you drowning while getting tattooed is “very slim”.
